Oﬀ-loading (OL). In the previous study on GPU-accelerated
query processing [17], OL is the major technique to exploit
the GPU. For example, the previous study [17] proposed to
oﬀ-load some heavy operators like joins to the GPU while
other operators in the query remain on the CPU. The basic
idea of OL on a step series is: the GPU is designed as a
powerful massively parallel query co-processor, and a step
is evaluated entirely by either the GPU or the CPU. Query
processing continues on the CPU until the oﬀ-loaded compu-
tation completes on the GPU, and vice versa. That is, given
a step series s1, ..., sn, we need to decide if si is performed
on the CPU or the GPU.
On the discrete architecture, the PCI-e data transfer over-
head is an important consideration for OL. The decision to
oﬀ-load a step aﬀects the decisions on other steps. As a re-
sult, we have to consider 2n possible o#oading schemes for
the step series. In contrast, on the coupled architecture, by
eliminating the data transfer overhead, the o#oading deci-
sion is relatively simple: depending only on the performance
comparison of running the steps on the CPU and the GPU.
